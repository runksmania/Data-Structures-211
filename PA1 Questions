istringstream and cin how do they know ints vs str

Following questions are from lines 60 thru 73 in main:
  Couldn't we cin >> int variables width, height, rgb?
  Do we need getline, istringsteam and then use istringstream to >> width, height?  
  Is there any advantage to doing the way it is in main? Memory, speed? Cleanliness of code? Or negligible either method?
  My suposition is negligible difference.

Line 122 in main. Why do we not check to see if file opened properly and is writeable?

Pixel::toString why not a void function that uses cout instead of ostringstream?

line 149 main  Why use getline and not just cin, wouldnt that remove the need for stoi and a string variable?  Any advantage?

line 169 main why the need for the if statement?

ppmDoccument questions:
  Constructor of PpmDocument why are variables initialized? Any benefit to doing this? Or is it just common practice?
  PpmDocument& operator=(const PpmDocument &other)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Move_assignment_operator
    && vs & any difference?
    Ts it just moving/copying the object?
  &getPixel.  Why the ampersand?
